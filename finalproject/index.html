For years, people had to rely on somebody else for their day-to-day chores or to get anything done. However, the recent advancements in technology has empowered the lives of people with disabilities in many ways and has made them more independent. Today a visually impaired can drive a car, operate home appliances; a disabled can tour around the world; and patients can even keep a track of their pills. Furthermore, technology can help people have access to information and healthcare similar to people without disabilities; decrease the barriers faced in their daily activities like reading, writing, speaking, and travelling; participate and avail the benefits of digital society.</p> -->

        <p>Accessibility is a measure of how usable a computing device or software is for all users, including users with disabilities. Accessibility is defined as the quality of being able to be reached or entered, easy to obtain or use, easily understood or appreciated. Accessibility is not optional, but it is the law, since accessibility is the “ability” to “access” which is why it so important. It is designing the world to include everyone, regardless of disability, so that others have access to more of life because it matters.</p>

        <h3>What is Accessibility?</h3>

        <p>According to Assistive Technology Industry Association, Assistive Technology is any product, equipment, or system that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities. Some categories of assistive technology are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Computer Access Aids</li>
          <li>Communication Aids</li>
          <li>Aids for Vision and Reasoning</li>
          <li>Aids for Hearing and Listening</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Center on Technology and Disability mentions three levels of Assistive Technology devices:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>High: Computerized or complex electronic aids that might require training like voice activated mobile devices or computer access software to operate them. </li>
          <li>Medium: Simple electronic features like closed caption televisions, and talking spell checkers.</li>
          <li>Low: They do not have any complex or mechanical features: pencil grips, handheld magnifiers, canes/walkers.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Some of the examples of such technologies that exist today are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Braille Keyboard: A keyboard designed for individuals who are blind or have low vision to type and enter instructions to the computer in Braille.</li>

          <li>A Microphone: In this technology, the person’s speech is converted into text or other action using software. It is useful for the people who find it difficult to operate a keyboard or a mouse.</li>

It makes use of their head movement through the built-in front-facing camera on the phone. The app, Open Sesame, has been nominated the Best Accessibility Experience award on Google Play!</li>

        <h3>Worldwide Statistics </h3>
        <p>The Zero Project, an initiative by the Essl Foundation, started in 2008, focuses on the rights of persons with disabilities globally. A survey conducted by them on assistive devices and technologies asked if[13], “there is public funding available to ensure that people with disabilities have access to the necessary assistive devices and technologies”. There was a clear divide in the responses between the continents. The gap between the countries with high development (1.7) and medium/low (2.7) is especially wide. Some support system in many low-income countries exists, but with poor quality and availability.</p>
        <img src="ZP 1.png" alt="Image showing the worldwide statistics for availability of public funds to ensure that people with disabilities have access to the necessary assistive devices and technologies" class="stack-image">
        <p class="caption">Source: <a href="https://zeroproject.org/indicator/assistive-devices-and-technologies-availability-of-public-funding-and-subsidies/">zeroproject.org</a></p>

        <p>Another question asked was about the accessibility of all modes of urban transport (bus, metro, tram, and train). 65% of the people from 78 countries (65%) answered “no.” Progress is reported from European countries and Northern America; however, inaccessibility remains the standard in low income countries.</p>
        <img src="ZP 2.png" alt="Image showing the worldwide statistics for the accessibility of all modes of urban transport" class="stack-image">
        <p class="caption">Source: <a href="https://zeroproject.org/indicator/public-transport-2018/">zeroproject.org</a></p>

        <p>One of the questions asked was about the availability of data on the number of accessible buildings which use the most common International Organization for Standardization Standard, 21542:2011 (it specifies requirements for the constructional aspects of access to buildings). This question is in line with the recommendation of the Sustainable Development Goals Advocacy Toolkit created by International Disability and Development Consortium, the United Nations, the International Disability Alliance. Almost no country has any data so far, or even has plans to get the data.</p>
        <img src="ZP 4.png" alt="Image showing the worldwide statistics for the availability of data on the number of accessible buildings which use the most common ISO Standard" class="stack-image">
        <p class="caption">Source: <a href="https://zeroproject.org/indicator/numbers-of-public-buildings-that-are-accessible-availability-of-data/">zeroproject.org</a></p>

        <p>On asking about the efforts being taken by national TV and radio broadcaster to make their programmes fully accessible, using sign language, audio description, or live captioning, the answers point to a variety of approaches, but not to comprehensive strategies being taken (with an exception of Germany).”</p>
        <img src="ZP 3.png" alt="Image showing the worldwide statistics for the efforts being taken by national TV and radio broadcaster to make their programmes fully accessible, using sign language, audio description, or live captioning" class="stack-image">
        <p class="caption">Source: <a href="https://zeroproject.org/indicator/numbers-of-public-buildings-that-are-accessible-availability-of-data/">zeroproject.org</a></p>


        <p>These numbers indicate that assistive technologies are far from the reach of a majority of the people and all the countries need to adopt ISO Standards, allocate more funds towards ensuring such devices and technologies are accessible to the people, and that everyone can avail the benefits of the digital age and live an independent life.</p>
