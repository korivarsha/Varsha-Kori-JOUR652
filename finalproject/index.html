      <blockquote>Hello, my name is Giora, I can't move my hands or legs. Can you make me a smartphone I could use?</blockquote>
      <p class="introtext">Oded Ben Dov, co-founder of Sesame Enable, the world’s first completely touch-free smartphone, mentions in an <a href="https://appdevelopermagazine.com/open-sesame-technology-changes-the-world-for-paralyzed-people/">article
          by the App Developer Magazine </a>that he was working in the gaming industry and was using head gestures to demo a game on TV that caught the attention of Giora, his now co-founder. Later, he called Dov and said: "Hello, my name is Giora,
        I can't move my hands or legs. Can you make me a smartphone I could use?" </p>
      <p class="introtext">Giora Livne, the co-founder of Sesame Enable, after suffering an accident while helping a friend, became quadriplegic and contacted Dov looking for a solution to help him live an independent life again, along with
        independently using a smartphone. Assistive technologies like Sesame Enable have helped Giora and many others. The rest... is history. </p>

        <h2 id="whatIsAssistiveTechnology"> What is Assistive Technology?</h2>
        <p>According to <a href="https://www.atia.org/at-resources/what-is-at/">Assistive Technology Industry Association</a>, Assistive Technology is any product, equipment, or system that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional
          capabilities of individuals with disabilities. Some <a href="https://www.ctdinstitute.org/library/2016-08-19/understanding-basics-assistive-technology">categories</a> of assistive technology are:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Computer Access Aids</li>
          <li>Communication Aids</li>
          <li>Aids for Vision and Reasoning</li>
          <li>Aids for Hearing and Listening</li>
        </ul>


        <p>The Center on Technology and Disability mentions three levels of Assistive Technology devices:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>High: Computerized or complex electronic aids that might require training like voice activated mobile devices or computer access software to operate them.</li>

          <li>Medium: Simple electronic features like closed caption televisions, and talking spell checkers.</li>

          <li>Low: They do not have any complex or mechanical features: pencil grips, handheld magnifiers, canes/walkers.</li>

        </ol>
        <h3>Examples of Assistive Technology</h3>
        <p>Like Sesame Enable, here are some of the other <a href="https://www.debatingeurope.eu/2016/02/18/will-new-technology-improve-accessibility-people-disabilities/#.W-Djt3pKh-W">successful examples</a> of assistive technologies that exist
          today. <i>You can hover over the images to read more.</i></p>

        <blockquote>We shouldn't need to know they have a disability," Andersson says. "It should just work for them.</blockquote><br><br><br>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/05/21/478925944/for-people-with-disabilities-new-technology-can-be-life-changing">article by npr.org</a> mentions that Google.org — the company's charitable arm, is
          supporting the endeavours of Sesame Enable. Eve Andersson, Director, Accessibility Engineering, says $20 million has been given by Google.org to organizations that help people with disabilities by using technology. According to her, a lot
          of technologies that help people with disabilities come out of technologies that are well-designed and aimed towards all consumers. "We shouldn't need to know they have a disability," Andersson says. "It should just work for them."</p>

                <h4>Education Level of People with Disabilities</h4>
                <p>Only 18% of the people with any disability have earned a bachelor degree or more. Almost an equal percentage of people have attended only a high school diploma or equivalent (42.7%) and only some college or an associate degree
                  (39.3%).</p>

          <h3>Worldwide Statistics </h3>
          <p>The Zero Project, an initiative by the Essl Foundation, started in 2008, focuses on the rights of persons with disabilities globally. A <a href="https://zeroproject.org/indicator/assistive-devices-and-technologies-availability-of-public-funding-and-subsidies/">survey</a>
            conducted by them on assistive devices and technologies asked if, “there is public funding available to ensure that people with disabilities have access to the necessary assistive devices and technologies”. There was a clear divide in
            the responses between the continents. The gap between the countries with high development (1.7) and medium/low (2.7) is especially wide. Some support system in many low-income countries exists, but with poor quality and availability.</p>

          <p>Another question asked was about the accessibility of all modes of urban transport (bus, metro, tram, and train). 65% of the people from 78 countries (65%) answered “no.” Progress is reported from European countries and Northern
            America; however, inaccessibility remains the standard in low income countries.</p>

          <p class="caption">Source: <a href="https://zeroproject.org/indicator/public-transport-2018/">zeroproject.org</a></p>

          <p>One of the questions asked was about the availability of data on the number of accessible buildings which use the most common International Organization for Standardization Standard, 21542:2011 (it specifies requirements for the
            constructional aspects of access to buildings). This question is in line with the recommendation of the Sustainable Development Goals Advocacy Toolkit created by International Disability and Development Consortium, the United Nations,
            and the International Disability Alliance. Almost no country has any data so far, or even has plans to get the data.</p>
          <img src="ZP 4.png" alt="Image showing the worldwide statistics for the availability of data on the number of accessible buildings which use the most common ISO Standard" class="stack-image">
          <p class="caption">Source: <a href="https://zeroproject.org/indicator/numbers-of-public-buildings-that-are-accessible-availability-of-data/">zeroproject.org</a></p>

          <p>On asking about the efforts being taken by national TV and radio broadcasters to make their programmes fully accessible, using sign language, audio description, or live captioning, the answers point to a variety of approaches, but not
            to comprehensive strategies being taken (with an exception of Germany).”</p>

          <p class="caption">Source: <a href="https://zeroproject.org/indicator/numbers-of-public-buildings-that-are-accessible-availability-of-data/">zeroproject.org</a></p>


          <p>These numbers indicate that assistive technologies are far from the reach of a majority of the people and all the countries need to adopt ISO Standards, allocate more funds towards ensuring such devices and technologies are accessible
            to the people, and that everyone can avail the benefits of the digital age and live an independent life.</p>

            it useful for a disabled person often does require new designs. But, as much as disabled people often benefit from technology developed for regular consumers, it also works the other way around." </p>

          <p>"We discovered that when we focus on users with disabilities our products get better for everybody", says Mike Shebanek, Senior Director, Accessibility, Yahoo.</p>
          <p>Hence, we should aim at making the technologies assistive, in addition to making assistive technologies.</p>
